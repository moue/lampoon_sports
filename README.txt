Description:  Sports website based off espn.com, sportsillustrated.com, and sportingnews.com. Website made using php, javascript, jquery plugins, and ESPN API. Submitted as first submission for Lampoon tech comp. 

Special setup: 

Navigation:  On the live site, you can always find the links to the 4 pages that I am submitting in the footer, and also below:

Home 		http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/podcast/sports/index.php
News 		http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/podcast/sports/article.php
Teams 		http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/podcast/sports/teams.php
NFL Draft 	http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/podcast/sports/players.php


Links: Almost all links are in the form of <a href=”#”>Dummy Link</a> and will not take you anywhere. The only links that will take you anywhere are the three image boxes on the home page, which all take you to the same article.  

On the menu ribbon, News, Teams, and 2014 NFL Draft are working links.  The image carousel on the 2014 NFL Draft page works. Clicking on any of the images will make it appear in the featured image section of the carousel. 

Headlines: Headlines are pulled using the ESPN sports API. If your internet connection is slow, headlines may take a few seconds to load, but it will load.

 Screen resolution: Beware small screen resolutions. This site is best viewed on a larger screen resolution. If the entirety of the menu ribbon is centered on the screen, then you’re at a good screen size / resolution. 

Load times: sometimes, the hcs.harvard.edu hosting is slow, so if you get a “webpage not available” page, just refresh the browser and the desired page should load.
